# 📅 Online Event Management Platform

## Overview

This beginner-friendly full stack project enables students to build a **web-based platform for managing events** — including registration, scheduling, and announcements. The project simulates real-world use cases such as college fests, hackathons, or club events where users can register, view event details, and receive updates.
